    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make this rich mac and cheese recipe healthier we use whole wheat bread crumbs, low-fat milk and cheese, whole wheat noodles, and reduced the amount of butter. Serve with a salad for a healthy meatless dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat macaroni (such as Smart Taste®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups low-fat (1%) milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour to make a roux. Slowly add milk to roux, stirring constantly. Stir in Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce is thick, about 3 minutes. Place macaroni in large baking dish and pour sauce over macaroni. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir until butter is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread over macaroni to cover. Sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese sauce is hot and breadcrumbs are browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
